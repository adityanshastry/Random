# Random

This repo will contain some random code written for some hackathon/fun projects:
1)  POS frequency based text summarization: This will provide the top n sentences, in any given text, which contain the highest frequency for Noun Based POS tags (NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS).
    TO-DO: Normalize the sentence frequency rank based on length of the sentence. 


Libraries used:
1) NLTK:  To perform sentence/word tokenization, and get the POS tags on the sentences
